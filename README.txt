Homework 1
4/28/2017

The program was tested and run on tux. The instructions will outline how to run the program on tux.

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
To compile the program, move all of the files within the submitted zip into the same folder on tux. Once there, navigate to the folder that the files are located in and run the command make. An executable called 'hw1' will be created in the same folder. To run the executable,  enter the command ./hw1>output-hw1.txt. The executable will run and the output will be sent to the text file 'output-hw1.txt'.

FILES INCLUDED
Main.cpp - The program containing the source code for homework one.
hw1 - The executable that I created on tux to run the program.
makefile - The makefile needed to create the executable of the source code.
output-hw1.txt - The output of the executable that was created when I ran the executable on tux.
SBP-level0.txt through SBP-level3.txt - The different boards for the assignment.

NOTES
RandomWalk uses SBP-level0.txt when it is run.
The breadth and depth searches use SBP-level1.txt when they are run.
I ran out of time and was not able to get the iterative deepening search complete. The sourcecode contained runs only RandomWalk, Breadth-search, and Depth-search.
